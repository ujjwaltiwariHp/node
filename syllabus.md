# 🧠 Node.js Full Roadmap (2025 Edition)

> ✅ Follow this path **sequentially**. You’re already done with basics — now let’s go next level!

---

## ✅ 1. **Node.js Core (You’ve Already Started)**

| Topic                                           | Status        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| ✅ What is Node.js & its non-blocking nature     | ✅ Done        |
| ✅ npm, package.json                             | ✅ Done        |
| ✅ Built-in modules: `fs`, `http`, `url`, `path` | ✅ Some done   |
| ✅ Creating servers with `http`                  | ✅ Done        |
| ✅ Event Loop, Callbacks, Promises, async/await  | In Progress   |
| ⏳ Understanding EventEmitter                    | ⬅️ Learn next |
| ⏳ Buffer & Streams (for file and network data)  | ⬅️ Learn soon |
| ⏳ Error Handling best practices                 | Coming soon   |

---

## 🚀 2. **Modules & File Architecture**

* ✅ `require` vs `import` (CommonJS vs ES Modules)
* 📁 Organize code into modules (`services/`, `controllers/`, `utils/`)
* 🧠 Learn `path`, `os`, `url` modules deeply
* 🔄 Environment variables (`dotenv`)

---

## 🔗 3. **Express.js – Fastest Web Framework**

> **Express = Node.js + Routing + Middleware + API = Clean Web App**

| Concept                           | Priority      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 🔄 Setting up Express server      | ⭐ Must        |
| 🧭 Routes & Parameters            | ⭐ Must        |
| 🔌 Middleware (custom & built-in) | ⭐ Must        |
| 📂 Folder structure (MVC style)   | ✅ Recommended |
| 🧾 Handling JSON & forms          | ✅ Must        |
| 🛑 Error handling middleware      | ✅ Must        |

---

## 🔐 4. **REST APIs – Create Real Backend**

> REST = API to handle frontend/backend connection

* ✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* 🧠 Status codes, HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* 🧪 Postman testing
* 🧱 Controllers + Routes + Models
* 🗃️ Connect to MongoDB (next step)

---

## 🛢️ 5. **MongoDB with Mongoose (NoSQL DB)**

| Topic                           | Priority |
| ------------------------------- | -------- |
| 🔌 Connecting MongoDB Atlas     | ✅ Must   |
| 🧬 Mongoose schemas & models    | ✅ Must   |
| 🛠️ CRUD with MongoDB           | ✅ Must   |
| 🔍 Querying, Filtering, Sorting | ⭐ Should |
| 🔄 Mongoose Middleware          | ⭐ Should |

---

## 🧾 6. **User Auth & Security 🔐**

* 🧠 JWT Authentication (Login + Signup)
* 🔐 Password hashing with `bcrypt`
* 🛑 Auth middleware to protect routes
* 🔒 Role-based access (admin/user)
* ⚠️ Helmet, Rate Limiting, CORS

---

## 🗂️ 7. **File Uploads & Advanced APIs**

* 📁 File uploads using `multer`
* 📸 Image compression with `sharp`
* 📊 Pagination, Search, Filters
* 📦 Caching with Redis (optional)

---

## 🕸️ 8. **WebSockets & Real-time Communication**

* 🧵 Learn basics of WebSocket
* ⚡ Implement real-time chat using `socket.io`

---

## 🧪 9. **Testing Your APIs**

* ✅ Unit tests: `jest`, `chai`, `mocha`
* 🔄 Integration testing: `supertest`

---

## 🚢 10. **Production & Deployment**

| Tool                         | Purpose                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 🧪 `.env` config             | Secret keys, environment vars       |
| 🔁 PM2                       | Process manager                     |
| 🚀 Deployment                | Render / Vercel / Railway / AWS EC2 |
| 🌐 Reverse Proxy             | NGINX setup (advanced)              |
| 🔒 HTTPS, Domains, SSL setup | (advanced)                          |

---

## 🎯 Bonus Topics (After Mastery)
